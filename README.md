# Data Science Portfolio – Luiza Magnani

This repository contains a collection of data science projects developed to
demonstrate my analytical thinking, technical skills, and ability to extract
business insights from data.

The projects focus on real-world datasets and cover the full data analysis
workflow, from data preparation and exploration to visualization and insights.

## About Me
I am a junior data scientist with experience in Python, SQL, and data
visualization. I am particularly interested in turning data into clear,
actionable insights that support decision-making.
